## TECH

- Vite ⚡
- SplineJS ✨
- 98.css

## TODO

- Model 3d renders using Spline
- Export code as vanilla js and paste the url into the respective spot in ``models.js``
- Press ``Run`` in replit to see your 3d renders live on the webview

### HINTS AND TIPS

- If you're user interaction is not working for the 2 spline designs in the about section, try removing from styles.css:
```
canvas {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```
- If your spline design is taking forever to load try debugging your design using Spline's ***3D Vitals***. This is found in the Spline editor at ``Export -> Play Settings -> 3d Vitals``.


## OPTIONAL

- Add Physics to your 3d spline render
- Go Crazy and add some game controls and music sounds
- Change the layout of the css
